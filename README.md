# tBTC at ETHDenver

Keep Network is going to be at [ETHDenver](http://ethdenver.com/) and helping developers get started building dApps using Bitcoin.

**In partnership with Compound, we're offering [a bounty for _the best Bitcoin to DeFi experience_](https://github.com/keep-network/ethdenver/issues/1)**. 

## Getting Started Building on tBTC

We recommend reading the [introduction to tBTC](docs/introduction-to-tbtc.md) for a short birds-eye overview.

Depending on what you build, you may need some testnet BTC and ETH. For sending transactions, we recommend GreenWallet.
